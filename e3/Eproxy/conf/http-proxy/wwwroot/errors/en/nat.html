Probably, you work through 'forced' proxy/NAT of your ISP, 
since IP, under which 'sees' you our server ({uDetectedIP @ NtoA}), 
does not coincide with yours ({uClientDetectedIP @ NtoA}). 
In this case we shall count the external network interface
of your server - this address: {uClientDetectedIP @ NtoA}.
