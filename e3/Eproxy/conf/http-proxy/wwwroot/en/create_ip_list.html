<h2>The configuration of proxy security</h2>
<p>
Attempt of autoconfiguration of proxy security will be 
now made. Thus the list of local subnets, access to proxy 
from which will be allowed, will be created. Connections 
to proxy from external networks will be prohibited.
<p>
For reliable detection what IP-address of your 
server is accessible from the outside, one attempt of a 
direct connection with the external web-server will be 
made. After that the file with customizations of security
({S" http-proxy\ip-list" RulesFile STR@}) will be created.
You can customize access rights manually in more details 
through the proxy control interface. The given automatic
customization is intended for exception of the not 
authorized access at the first call to the not configured
server.
