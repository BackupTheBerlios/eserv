<H2>Service plugin</H2>
<p>
In operating systems Windows NT4, 2000, XP {PROGNAME} can work as 
system service - to be started automatically at computer boot time,
and "invisible", irrespective of operation of users on this computer.     

<p>To install {PROGNAME} as a service
click <a href=install.html>Install service</a>, to
uninstall - <a href=uninstall.html>Uninstall service</a>. To start
service - <a href=start.html>Start service</a>, to stop -
<a href=stop.html>Stop service</a>.
Take into account, that after stop of service proxy ceases to work
- and you can not start it back through this web-interface 
if your browser is customized to work through stopped proxy.
It is better to customize a browser to work with this web-interface
directly, not via proxy.

<p>Also it is possible to control service from a control panel.
The service name - {PROGFILE}.
